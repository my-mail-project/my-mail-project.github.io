# My name is Mark
## and you may have some of my mail

In February 2021, we have distributed 100 envelopes addressed to people all around the world. Passed between people, these envelopes will 
travel across uncharted interpersonal networks and gently alight on their destination. 

*We have no idea how long this will take.* It could take weeks. It could take years. Serendipity is a beautiful and unpredictable
thing.

## If you have an envelope

[Please log it](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScET7yQ-EsC9XcU9C10_-JEDKle6BauKJiz5RjW38yuDgBPwA/viewform) 
so that we can track it.

Then we ask that you -

- pass the envelope to someone else who will carry the envelope on
- add something two-dimensional and personally meaningful, like a sketch or a note, to the contents of the envelope, if you can

Please don't -

- send the envelope through the mail (unless you're sending a package anyway - in that case, feel free to slip it in)
- go more than fifteen minutes out of your way to deliver an envelope
- add anything bulky, dangerous, or illegal
- hold on to the envelope for long. Please try to keep it moving

## If you'd like an envelope

Here's a map of where it's been and where it is going.
