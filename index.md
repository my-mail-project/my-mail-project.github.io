# Hi! My name is Mark

### What's taking place

In February 2021, we have distributed 100 envelopes addressed to people all around the world. Passed between people, these envelopes will 
exploit the existing interpersonal networks 

*We have no idea how long this will take.* It could take weeks. It could take years. Serendipity is a beautiful and unpredictable
thing.

### How to participate

If you've got an envelope, [please log it](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScET7yQ-EsC9XcU9C10_-JEDKle6BauKJiz5RjW38yuDgBPwA/viewform) 
so that we can track it.

Then we ask that you -

- pass the envelope to someone else who will carry the envelope on
- add something two-dimensional and personally meaningful, like a sketch or a note, to the contents of the envelope

Please don't -

- send the envelope through the mail (unless you're sending a package anyway - in that case, you can slip it in)
- go more than fifteen minutes out of your way to deliver an envelope
- add anything bulky, dangerous, or illegal
- hold on to the envelope for long. Please try to keep it moving
